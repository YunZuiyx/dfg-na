`npm i`

## Development server

### client

`cd client`

Run `ng serve` or `npm run start` for a angular dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Server

Before run server instance,make sure you have executed
`cp server\src\modules\database\database.providers.sample.ts server\src\modules\database\database.providers.ts`, and edited the file appropriately.

`cd server`

Run `npm run start:dev` for a nestjs server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

### client components

`cd client\src\app\components`

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### server modules

`cd server\src\modules`

Run `nest generate module module-name` to generate a new module. You can also use `nest generate angular-app|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|filter|module`.

## Build

### client build

`cd client`

Run `ng build` to build the client project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

### server build

`cd server`

Run `npm run prestart:prod` to build the server project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## docker
